Value fetching and displaying result in same page using PHP

Ex:- 2 values to be added after submit. if values are not present, change textbox colour to red using CSS, is present, then continue.
if either is not present, colour the textbox not having value only.
if both present,add and display on the same page. Even after submitting the Submit button,Values should remain in the textboxes using PHP.
